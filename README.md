# HamBaangLaang storybooks audio recordings

This repository contains multilingual audio for the [HamBaangLaang](http://hambaanglaang.hk) project. The audio consists of readings of a collection of storybooks from a variety of sources -- original works and stories from [Storyweaver](https://storyweaver.org.in/) (Pratham Books) and [Storybooks Hong Kong](https://global-asp.github.io/storybooks-hongkong/) ([African Storybook](https://africanstorybook.org/)).

## Structure

All audio files can be found in the `audio` folder within this repo, arranged by language. See the [section below](#languages) for a list of language codes.

Within each language folder, the stories in the collection are arranged in separate folders by their individual [Story ID](#stories).

The story folders each contain a single full-length MP3 file, as well as a folder labelled `mp3`. The full-length MP3 file contains the entire story being read aloud as a single file, while the files in the `mp3` folder have been split into individual pages from the full-length file. If you just want to hear the story read aloud, you will probably want the full-length file only. However, the split files have multiple possibilities for alternative uses and extended applications.

## Languages

The story audio is currently only available in Cantonese (`yue`). Further languages will be added as they become available.
